# PERS - Physics Engine for Robotics Simulations

C++ physics engine mainly meant for visualisation, simulation and testing inverse kinematics 
algorithms for walking robots.

# Installation
Project can be easily opened with Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 just by opening pers.sln file.
There are future plans to migrate to CMAKE.

# Roadmap
 - ~~Implement graphics using OpenGL and GLFW~~
 - ~~Physical and graphical representatons of objects~~
 - ~~Basic UI elements (made with IMGUI)~~
 - Real-Time collision detection
 - Fully functional physics simulatiom
 - Model creation and finished UI
 - Randomly generated enviroments for walking tests
 - Implement machine learning algorithms for AI generated walking sequences
